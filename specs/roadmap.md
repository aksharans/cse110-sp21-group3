# Project Roadmap


## Weeks 1-3: Team/Project Intro

In these weeks, we were introduced to the class and the project, and got to know our team through the kickoff meetings.

## Weeks 4-5: Brainstorming, Users, & Project Design

In these weeks, we started brainstorming ideas for the project, including a couple of brainstorming sessions where we came up with ideas and rough designs. We compiled ideas on Miro and took notes on specific functionalities and ways to implement them. We also discussed the direction of our BuJo and decided on drawing upon the Theme System. In addition, we also had user-centered design sessions where we came up with user personas and aligned our ideas around those.



## Week 6: Staring Pitch & Begin Coding

In this week, we compiled our starting pitch, which included and got the OK after adding in a couple needed documents. After that, we started exploratory programming where we created basic code to implement some ideas.  Also, we started to compile some of the different features and issues we would work on and started to get a sense of how to delegate tasks.


## Weeks 7-8: Sprint 1 & CI/CD

In these weeks, we had our first sprint, where we split up into groups that would work on the journal creation pages and the daily log home page, as well as started other components towards the end. We also implemented our CI/CD pipeline during this sprint with the linting and dummy testing, as well as set up the deployment to netlify. In our sprint review, we discussed the trends/habits pages, how to store data, and the intial ideas. In our retro, we said that the task delegation and basic functionality went well while confusions on designs and implementation didn't go well. 


## Weeks 9-10: Sprint 2

In these weeks, we had our second sprint, where we got a lot more work done and we worked on the navbar/menu, improved rapid logging system through the TextEditor, the collections page, and monthly log page, as well as started to organize and tie the code together. We were able to make improvements in both our design and implementation. In our sprint review, we discussed the status of the app and its components so far, as well as some more design decisions involving storage, and set a timeline and started planning for the next week. In our retro, we said that we were able to get a lot of work done very cleanly while there where still some issues in terms of implementation


## Weeks Finals: Sprint 3 (Wrap-Up, Ongoing at Time Written)

In these week, we had our final sprint where we begain tying together all aspects of the project and worked on finishing any outstanding tasks (including past logs, routing, finishing monthly logs/collections) and focusing on the repo, documentation generataion, and non-code items. We tied together all the pages and focused on any glaring issues or bugs and also started to implement unit tests and formalized the end-to-end testing procedures. In addition, we had checkups for the status of the final tasks, added the last issues, and started working on the project videos for submission.
