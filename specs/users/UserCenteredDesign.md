# User Centered Design & Principles
for the "product", Task Overflow's Bullet Journal  


## Defining the Users & Their Goals

### Users
- The users are those, particularly the ages 15-35 (especially students in high school & college or recent grads), who want to strive for productivity (in health/lifestyle, outlook, achieving goals, finance, and more), but are unable to achieve their needs due to a lack of direction or organization, and they can come from all walks of life. Users may have previously used Bullet Journaling or a similar method, or are completely new to the domain and looking for a fresh solution. 

### Goals & Jobs to be Done
- Users want to be able to improve their daily and future lifestyle by following themes and noting habits.
- Users want to get organized in all aspects of their life through note-taking and task management.
- Users want to have a deeper connection to their "inner escennce" by reflecting and observing their thoughts throughout the day.


## User (P/G)ains

### Pains
- Not having a direction or a "guiding star"
- Not being able to neatly & efficiently organize things
- Not having an acceptable digital version of the paper BuJo

### Gains
- Being able to have the option to have guidance and structure when bulleting.
- Being able to quickly jot notes/tasks/events/other things and seamlessly arrange them.
- Using a product that's similar enough to the traditional BuJo, but has some extra features that leverage the digital aspect.


## Problems & Solutions

### User Problems: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt

- Fear: User may be wary that the product could cause more harm than help.
- Uncertainty: User may not know if they will want to really use the product.
- Doubt: User may not be sure if the product will actually help them.


### Solution: Ilities

- Desirability: Product should be appealing to use, not necessarily in its front-end design, but rather the features it provides.
- Usability: Product should not be overly complex nor too trivial and it should be easy for the users.
- Functionality: Product should operate as a modified BuJo.
- Reliablity: Product should not have unexpected responses.
- Availablilty: Product should be acessible.
- Security: Product should preserve the user's personal writing.
- Maintainability: Product should be able to add features without major revamps.
- Resilience: Product should expect and handle all sorts of user input and manipulation.
- Performance: Product should not have major overhead runtime costs.


## User Feeling & Outcomes

- Users should feel as if the product is meeting or exceeding their needs in boosting productivity.
- Users should feel more organized and as if they have a positive guiding light.
- Users, after using the product, should have an improved lifestyle, according to their terms, and be able to positively work towards their other goals.

## Accessibility (Features)

- Be able to utilize the product using keyboard shortcuts, or have a sort of virtual keyboard.
- Be able to take notes using speech or video.
- Tutorial on first load.
- Light and Dark themes.


## User Acceptance

Through UCD & UDD, all decisions should be made so that users will not reject the ideas and implementations of the product. This can be simulated by always starting from the user and then working towards the end goal.
user -> idea -> feature -> design -> implementation -> refinement -> deployment.
