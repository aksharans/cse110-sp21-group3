# [Remove/Include Collections]

* Status: Accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: All team <!-- optional -->
* Date: 04-21-2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Should our BuJo support users to maintain topic specific notes / collections? If yes, should we allow users to label daily logs according to collections category?

## Considered Options

1. Discard collections support
2. Support linking daily logged tasks to collections categories
3. Support collections but without any links with daily logging
   
## Decision Outcome

[option 3] Because allowing the user a blankspace to jot down important notes will significantly improve the user experience. Moreover, keeping it seperate from task logging will not affect our rapid logging feature

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [option 1]
Discard collections support

* Good, because we don't deviate from our core feature - bullet journalling and rapid logging
* Bad, because user has no space to jot down important notes not part of daily tasks

### [option 2]
Support linking daily logged tasks to collections categories

* Good, because users can filter our their tasks according to categories (if needed)
* Bad, because it negatively imapcts rapid logging.

### [option 3]
Support collections but without any links with daily logging

* Good, because users get a blank space to jot down notes like shopping list, movie list, etc.
* Good, because keeping it seperate from daily logging does not affect rapid logging
