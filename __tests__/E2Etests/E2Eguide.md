# End to End Testing Guide/Procedures

Procedures we used when performing manual end to end tests.

## Setup

1. Push feature branch & validate building, linting, testing, and Codacity analysis checks were successful. If not, first fix those errors. 
2. Either use VSCode's Live Server or Netlify's deploy preview to check branch site is running.
3. Open a Pull Request and request reviews through Github and/or team's Slack pull-requests channel, or ask for a branch review in team's general channel.
