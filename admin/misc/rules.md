Any additional meetings scheduled will be announced at least 24 hours in advance. The team will set the agenda for the next meeting 24 hours prior to the meeting times. 

### 4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members

All team members will complete their required assignments before the due date. All team members will communicate with the team leads and each other should a situation arise.

### 5. Specific Team Members and Resposibilities

Specific responsibilities are to be decided. 

### 6. Conflict Resolution

If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team leads will first reach out to them to assess the situation. The team will attempt to resolve any other conflicts among themselves (during meetings, etc) but if the situation continues, it will be brought to a mentor.

### 7. Expectations of Faculty and GTAs

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff and team leads will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
