## Agenda

### Direction of Journal App

- Theme System + Habits definitely rings true to us
- Concerns of direction between tons of structure (categories, tags, etc.) and
  simplicity (more loosely structured, oriented towards traditional BuJo)
- Converged to starting from simplicity to ability to add features and structure

### Core Features of Journal

- Daily Log is important
- Theme System & Habits are essential, too
- First-time users get onboarding about Theme System, etc.
- Journal creation gets Setup page
- Concern with split between Theme System and BuJo
  - Tasks could be placed in Future Log separate from journals?
- Weekly Review for theme
- Insert Images or Video in the daily log
- Separate space with collections to pull up tasks to
- Reflection questions to orient you to the Theme System mindset
